* Introduction:

Uses the fasterac library, written by LPC Caen, to extract both ADC and Counter data from .faster files generated by a MOSAHR motherboard. It then writes this data to an HDF5 file. For each FASTER channel, a Detector group is constructed, container two tables: ADC and Counter. The group has the FASTER label as an attribute.

* Compilation options:

h5cc -o fast2hdf5 -lfasterac -std=c11 fast2hdf5.c
